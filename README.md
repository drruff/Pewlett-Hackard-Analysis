- There are 2 managers retiring, which is the least of any title group, however in a previous analysis there is only 5 acitve managers, which means this is 40% of the mangement team.
- There are no managers eligible for the mentorship program.
- All other titles have many people eligble for the mentorship program.

## Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

THere is 72,458 positions retiring soon, with the biggest two being "senior engineer" and "senior staff" with 25916, 24926 retiring in each respectfully. However, management is the one with the biggest impact, with 40% of the management team retiring soon (at only 2 people, however, management is only a team of 5).

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There is a total of 1549 people who qualify for the mentorship eligeblity, varying across all titles with the exception of management. As long as each mentor can mentor a group of people (around 30-50 people each) there should be no problems with the exception of management. Since management has no mentorship eligeblity, this will need to be handled either prior to the employees retiring, or using other means.
